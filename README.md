# ENTAPRITA

This is just an interpreter in C. Going to make notes here, nothing special.

## What is an interpreter?

This is a program that is written in a high level language that executes code without converting to machine language.

## Steps in building an interpreter

### Lexing

Also known as scanning. A scanner takes in a string of characters and outputs a stream of tokens. Tokens are the building blocks of the language.

### Parsing

This is the process of developing larger parts from the smaller components. It takes a stream of tokens and forms ASTs.(Abstract Syntax Trees or parse trees) It reports syntax errors as well.

### Static Analysis
